<!--

  These will be the main types of tasks in the quiz project:
    `type: components`
    `type: css`
    `type: logic`
    `type: handlers`


  Some general changes you will need to make:
  - client/data/quiz.js (to add questions)
  - client/config.js (to configure your repo name for deployment)

  For each user story you may need to write code in:
  - client/src/components
  - client/src/handlers
  - client/src/logic
  - client/styles
  - client/public

  everything else should work already!

# Components

* Button. Save text-argument(parameter) and color-argument(parameter).
* Title and text feedback (with one parameter "text" but with different data).
* Question (with title "Question with number" and paragraph question itself).
* Check boxes. It is a combination with all squares and questions.
  * Check mark (with red, green or not highlighted components as an arguments or parameters).
* Progression bar with passed questions (correct and incorrect answers) and    not yet passed.
